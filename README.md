A data analysis project exploring flight delays and cancellations at major U.S. airports using Python and visualizations. The project includes detailed insights into airport operations and performance trends.
 Flight Delay and Cancellation Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on flight delays and cancellations at major U.S. airports. The analysis examines trends, cancellation rates, and performance metrics for airports such as LAX, MIA, and JFK, using a variety of Python data science libraries.

## Features

- **Airports Analyzed**: Los Angeles (LAX), Miami (MIA), and New York John F. Kennedy (JFK)
- **Graphs and Visualizations**: The project includes multiple plots detailing hourly and daily cancellation rates, delay patterns, and on-time performance.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: The analysis explores factors contributing to delays, cancellation trends, and airport efficiency based on real-world data.

## Files

- `Project 3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full data analysis, including code and visualizations.
- `Flight Analysis.pdf`: A PDF summary of the key findings from the analysis, highlighting insights from each airport.

## Getting Started

To view the analysis and graphs without rerunning the code, simply open the `Project 3.ipynb` notebook on GitHub or a Jupyter Notebook viewer.

If you'd like to rerun the notebook or modify the code, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
